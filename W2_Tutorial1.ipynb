Regression is commonly applied when we want to find the relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. For example, if we want to examine the relative impacts of age, gender, and diet (the independent variables) on height (the dependent variable). On the other hand, a regression can be used for predictive analysis. Thus the independent variables are also called predictors. When the model contains more than one predictor, then the method is called *multiple regression*, and if it contains more than one dependent variable called *multivariate regression*.\n",
