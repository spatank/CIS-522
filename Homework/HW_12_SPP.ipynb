The goal of the actor network is to predict the action that maximizes the Q-value given the current state. This effectively amortizes the argmax search into training. Concretely, let $\\mu_{\\theta}$ be an actor network paramterized by $\\theta$. The actor's objective is to output an action that maximizes its Q-value:\n",

Here we use a multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layers of 256 neurons each with ReLU activations for the hidden layers and tanh for the final layer. This assumes an action space bounded in [-1,1]. In case we do differ from that, we keep track of the true max value and scale the result accordingly.

We will use the same tricks from the DQN models with regard to experience replay and target networks. Implementations to enable both of these are provided. We will also follow a similar pattern as in the tutorials where the DDPGAgent class will implement the act and train methods which are used to interact with the povided `learn_env` method. Given the added complexity needing to update two networks, we have broken those parts out into an `update` method which is where you will implement the actor and critic training steps.\n",

Since we can't do that here, we will instead add a small amount of noise to the continous action value. You can see this in the `act` method.\n",

An inverted pendulum starts in a random position and we must apply a real-valued force to get the pendulum to remain upright. The task ends after 200 steps with the reward at each step based on the current position, change in position, and force applied. This works out well as a test case for DDPG as there are only three elements in the state space and just a single element in the action space which makes this relatively fast to run and also achieve good results.\n",

As a leader in a private organization, I am responsible for profits and beholden to my shareholders. This means that standards can often seem like rigid regulatory barriers that inhibit my ability to maximize profits. I would be hard-pressed to advance R&D on a technology that is likely to be curtailed by a standard that is behind its times. This makes it crucial for agencies that develop standards to balance the regulatory role of standards with their potential to drive innovation. In my view, standards are important indicators for a private-sector entity in order to decide how to innovate. By contrast, under standards frameworks such as those in the US and EU, public officials are optimizing a totally different cost function to their private sector counterparts. They are concerned with how best to preserve taxpayer money and optimally deploy it to maximize utility. Since profits are replaced by value, standards no longer act as scaffolds for innovation. \" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n",
