The most interesting feature of the site, however, is the ability to play artificially intelligent agents at various skill levels. One of the agents is even named Beth Harmon.  Many top rated players like Magnus Carlsen routinely practice against the best chess AIs to improve their skills. While such game-playing agents have indeed transformed their communities, I am not sure to what extent the technological advances that make them work have trickled down into consumer products.

The match between Lee Sedol and AlphaGo brought massive publicity to the game, which translated into more people wanting to participate. For instance, after the match there was a shortage of Go boards worldwide. Additionally, as the article points out with the dolphin and Michael Phelps example, there will always be interest in how humans fare against each other regardless of how good AI gets. On a more technical game-playing level, AlphaGo will in all likelihood bring out the best from Go masters. For every move 37 that AlphaGo digs out, masters like Lee Sedol will be forced to find a move 78. This will ensure that game-playing agents will be used by masters in their preparation before tournaments like Fan Hui did before the European Championships. I also ended up watching the movie by DeepMind.  One aspect from AlphaGo's game-play that was immediately evident to experts was that as long as a player is winning, they need not care by how many points they win. As people study AlphaGo, chances are that they may start adopting more of its tactics in their own styles of play. Using AI to teach new students how to play Go makes me a little uncomfortable. As a child, I would play the chess engine on my computer and always end up losing. This put me off from the game for a long time. I believe that agents like AlphaGo would have to learn to adapt to their opponent's skill levels if they are to be effective teaching tools. Additionally, they would have to be paired with an explicitly non-competitive teaching-oriented agent that points out why the game is being played the way it is by the computer.\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n",

        "reflection_2 = \"I am pretty surprised and excited by AlphaZero being used as a tool to condense decades of exploration of new chess variants into a really short period of time. This application of game-playing AI agents was not immediately obvious to me before I read the Wired article. What I particularly like about this approach is that the ultimate goal at all times is to improve the game of chess for humans. AI lends a helping hand in this process, contrary to its typical portrayal as a direct challenger to humans. The fact that DeepMind can do this with AlphaZero is also very neat since it shows how generalizable the agent is. As a designer using deep learning to create new games, I don't think I'd leave any ethical judgements to the agents. I would let them generate a game, and then run it by ethics experts after the fact. Any judgements left to the agents are in all likelihood going to be a reflection of the data that they are trained on. Human designers will have an important role to play in ensuring that this data is as free as possible from biases. Additionally, as always they will need to ensure that the games are enjoyable, and competitive when required. I don't think that the jobs of game developers are going to change massively. Deep learning agents are only as creative as the randomness that is built into them. Their outputs are still very much a reflection of human-designed games that already exist. For a new game to be truly creative and revolutionary, I'd argue that it still needs to be designed by humans. In this effort, deep learning based agents may be incredibly useful, however. If a game developer can leverage an agent to write code on their behalf, and focus only on the big-picture of what they want to accomplish, then that partnership is likely to be highly productive.\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n",
