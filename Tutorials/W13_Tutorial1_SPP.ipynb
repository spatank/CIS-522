Capsules mainly rely on equivariance, which is a property which results in the output undergoing an identical transformation to any applied to the input. This is in contrast to invariance, which results in no changes to output even with transformations in input. For images, equivariance means that any change in viewpoint of an image will result in nonlinear changes to pixels and linear changes to observed sub-objects (e.g. facial features like the nose, mouth, and eyes).\n",

It also outputs information about the sub-object's characteristics (e.g. pose, lighting, orientation), providing a canonical representation of the sub-object.  \n",

Another strategy involves specialized regularization designed to prevent too much change from occurring in the weights of the model.
