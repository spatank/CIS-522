We started off with a glorious introduction of AlphaZero, studied the basic components of deep learning, and grinded throught convnets, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Now, we stand at the end of Week 12, the last week of \"real\" material. In this tutorial, we will go all the way back to week 1 and revisit AlphaZero! The goal is to show that over the course of CIS 522, and particularly the RL weeks, you have been equipped with enough deep learning knowledge to truly understand how AlphaZero works! This will be purely an intellectual journey, and there will be no code for you to implement.\n",

        "How can we train an agent to drive a car in real world? Obviously, there are so many scenarios that any attempt at designing a reward function would fail miserably. In addition, there is no good mechanism to issue the rewards. What we do have is plenty of human drivers, or experts. If experts can stay in the middle of the road, then we should be able to do the same by imitiating what the expert does for any given observation. This intuition leads to a method for solving sequential decision making problems without rewards -- **imitation learning**. In particular, what we just mentioned is called **behavioral cloning**. \n",
        "\n",
        "In behavioral cloning, we train a neural network to predict an action given a state. This is exactly a policy network, but rather than maximizing the reward, we simply maximize the log likelihood of the expert's action given an observation. Let $D$ denote a dataset of expert demonstrations, the objective of behavioral cloning is:\n",

        "\n",
        "Using plain behavioral cloning can lead to catastrophic failure. This is because the prediction error of our model compounds as we execute more actions, which eventually leads to a state not covered in the dataset's distribution. The model would have no idea what to do there. The **DAgger (Dataset Aggregation) algorithm** addresses this distributional shift by adding a data collection and labelling step to behaviorial cloning. In this way, it pulls the policy distribution closer to the data distribution, and provably leads to fewer errors. The pseducode is as follows:\n",

Then, run the second cell to collect expert demonstrations. We store the data in a replay buffer of states and actions. Finally, follow the instuctions to complete the training and model update functions of behavior cloning. Since the dynamics of CartPole is very simple, we don't need DAgger to solve it."

        "## Key concepts in RL\n",
        "\n",
        "We are now ready to see our old friend AlphaZero again. Let's summarize a few key concepts in reinforcement learning introduced over the past two weeks, and try to connect them to AlphaZero in the rest of the tutorial. \n",
        "\n",
        "- Recall that a reinforcement learning problem can be formalized as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**. A MDP is a tuple $(S, A, P, R, \\gamma)$, where $S$ denote the set of states, $A$ the set of actions, $P$ the transition function, $R$ the reward function, and $\\gamma$ the discount factor. An MDP satisfies the Markov property since the reward and transition can be determined from the current state and action, without knowing the history. The reward is typically a function of state and action, but we can also have it be a function of state, or of state, action and next state. \n",
        "- A **policy** is a mapping from states to distributions over actions. The objective of reinforcement learning is to find a policy that maximizes the expected total reward: $$ \\pi^* = \\arg\\max_{\\pi}E_{\\pi}\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t R(s_t, a_t)\\right]$$\n",
        "- The **value** of a state $V^{\\pi}(s)$ is defined as the expected total reward obtained by following policy $\\pi$ starting from state $s$. The value of a state-action pair, or the **Q-value**, $Q^{\\pi}(s, a)$ is deined as the expected total reward obtained by taking action $a$ at state $s$ and then following policy $\\pi$. Value and Q-value satisfy the Bellman equations. Using the Bellman equations, we can derive two algorithms for solving MDP with known transitions: **policy iteration** and **value iteration**.\n",
        "- To solve an MDP without knowledge of its transitions, we can use **temporal difference (TD) learning**. The idea is to update the value estimate of state $s_{t}$ by bootstraping a value of $s_{t+1}$ from the current value estimates. Two instantiations of TD learning are **Q-learning** and **SARSA**. Later in actor-critic methods we also saw $n$-step TD-methods, where we bootstrap a value after rolling out $n$ steps.\n",
        "- **Deep Q-learning** extends Q-learning to large state spaces by approximating the Q-values with a deep neural net. We need a few tricks to get it to work well, including replay buffer, target network, and double DQN. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) further extends DQN to continuous action spaces.\n",
        "- **Policy gradient method** (REINFORCE) directly optimizes a neural-network-parametrized policy using gradient ascent. Since the objective involves an expectation, we need to use a score function estimator and Monte-Carlo sampling to estimate the gradient. The vanilla policy gradient suffers from a high variance, which we mitigate with reward-to-go and discounting.\n",
        "- To further reduce the varaince of policy gradients, we can subtract an unbiased baseline from the cumulative future reward term. A good baseline is the value function. This lead to the **actor-critic algorithm**, in which we jointly train an actor (policy) and a critic (value function). \n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, here are some recurring themes:\n",
        "- **On-policy vs Off-policy**: A method is on-policy if learning needs to be done with examples generated using the current policy, and off-policy otherwise. Q-learning is off-policy, whereas SARSA is on-policy. DQN is off-policy, whereas policy gradient is on-policy. \n",
        "- **Model-based vs Model-free**: A model-based RL algorithm approximates the dynamics of an environment using a model (e.g. neural network). It then plans from the model or use the model to provide additional training data for model-free algorithms. \n",
        "- **Exploration vs exploitation**: In any RL algorithm, we need to balance exploration and exploitation. Particularly, we need to make sure that the algorithm explores enough states to be able to learn the optimal policy. In Q-learning, this is handled by episilon-greedy policy, whereas a stochastic policy in policy gradient automatically takes care of that.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the remaining sections of the tutorial, there will be no video or code for you to implement. Thus, we encourage you to turn on your cameras and work through the rest of the tutorial with your pod. \n"

        "\n",
        "Recall that the game of Othello involves two players and an 8x8 (or 6x6) board. Initially, four stones are placed at the center of the board. Players 1 (black) and player 2 (white) take turns placing stones on the board. A move is legal if 1) its position is adjacent to one of opponent's pieces, and 2) placing the stone will cause a \"flip\": all of opponents pieces trapped between the new piece and exisiting pieces are flipped. When neither player has a legal move, the player with  more stones on the board wins the game. Run the following code cells and make a few moves to familiarize yourself with the rules."

AlphaZero is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a deep neural net to provide heuristics for Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We will go over MCTS in a bit, but let's first look at the deep learning components of AlphaZero.\n",

        "At the core of Alphazero is a convolutional neural network $f_{\\theta}$ with two heads: a value head and a policy head. The network takes an $n\\times n$ board state as input and outputs two things: a value of the board state $v_{\\theta}(s) \\in [-1, 1]$ and a policy $\\mathbf{p}_{\\theta}(s)$, which is a probability vector over actions. The value estimates the expected outcome of the board state, and the policy mimics the normalized visit counts of all actions collected by MCTS. Formally, given a state $s$, its expected outcome $z$ and a vector of normalized visit counts $\\mathbf{\\pi}$, the network is trained to minimize a sum of MSE loss and cross-entropy loss: $$\\ell = (z - v_{\\theta}(s))^2 - \\mathbf{\\pi}^\\top \\log \\mathbf{p}_{\\theta}(s) + c\\|\\theta\\|^2$$ where $c$ controls the weight of L2 regularization. Note that unlike in actor-critic algorithms where the policy is used for inference and the value networks guides policy training, here both the policy and the value are auxiliary to MCTS. We will see in the next part how the policy and the value are used. In inference time, we run MCTS for a fixed number of iterations and normalize the actual visit counts to get the policy."

        "AlphaZero uses Monte-Carlo Tree search to improve its policy estimates and to generate the final policy. Recall that in an MCTS tree, each node corresponds to a board state, and each edge represents a transition by a valid move. An edge maintains three attributes: the expected reward for taking the action $Q(s, a)$, the number of times this edge has been visited $N(s, a)$, and the number of times the node has been visited $N(s)$. By now, you should be much more comfortable with the meaning of Q-value than you were back in week 1.\n",

        "Let's review the tree-growing procedure in more detail. In the beginning of each game, we start with an empty tree. In each turn, we grow the tree by a fixed number of nodes using MCTS. Specifically, each node is grown by starting from current state $s_t$ and taking actions that maximize the upper confidence bound (UCB) until a new leaf is grown. If this new leaf corresponds to a terminal state, then we take its reward and propagate all the way down to the root. Otherwise we bootstrap a value estimate of the new leaf state from the neural network and do the same propagation. By propagation, we mean that for each edge $(s, a)$ along the path, set $Q(s, a) = \\frac{Q(s, a) * N(s, a) + v}{N(s, a) + 1}$, where $v$ is the reward or the value of the leaf state. Note that this is the only place where we use the value network $v_{\\theta}$. Finally, having performed a number of searches in a turn, the statistics at $s_t$ provides a good estimate of the optimial policy. We sample an action from the normalized visit counts to take in this turn: $\\pi(a) = \\frac{N(s, a)}{N(s)}$."
