        "Last week, we learned our first deep reinforcement learning algorithm -- deep Q-learning. Deep Q-learning has its root in tabular Q-learning, where we estimate the value of each action at a state and take the action with the maximum value. As we have seen, deep Q-learning is powerful and can be leveraged to solve Atari games from high-dimensional observations. However, it has a few drawbacks: \n",
        "\n",
        "- The policy implied by Q-Learning is deterministic. This means that Q-Learning can’t learn stochastic policies, which can be useful in some environments. It also means we need to create our own exploration strategy since following the policy will not perform any exploration. We usually do this with $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration which can be quite inefficient.\n",
        "- There is no straightforward way to handle continuous actions in Q-Learning. We can go around this by having an additional actor network which predicts the argmax action. This leads to the DDPG algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that the goal of reinforcement learning is to learn an optimal **policy**. Can we do that directly? In this tutorial, we will introduce another family of RL algorithms called policy gradient methods, which optimize the policy directly using gradients of the RL objective. Here are a few reasons why policy gradient can be desirable:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- In policy gradient, handling continous actions is relatively easy.\n",
        "- As its name suggests, in policy gradient we are following gradients with respect to the policy itself, which means we are constantly improving the policy. By contrast, in Q-learning we are improving our estimates of the values of different actions, which only implicitly improves the policy. You would think that improving the policy directly would be more efficient, and indeed it very often is.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main topic of this tutorial is policy gradient, covered in sections 1 through 3. In section 4, we will briefly go over another paradigm for solving reinforcement learning problems, namely model-based RL. "

Let $\\pi_{\\theta}$ be  a policy parametrized by $\\theta$, where $\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s)$ is the probability of taking an action $a$ in the current state $s$. Our goal is to iteratively update the parameters $\\theta$ such that $\\pi_{\\theta}$ eventually becomes the optimal policy. In particular, we want to find an update rule from $\\theta_t$ to $\\theta_{t+1}$ that leads us to the optimal policy $\\theta^*$.\n",

In either case, we sample an action from the distribution to execute in inference time."

The full derivation of policy gradient using the score function estimator can be found in the appendix, but for our purposes we only need to know that $\\nabla_{\\theta}J(\\theta)$ takes the following form:\n",

To estimate the policy gradient, we sample $N$ policy rollouts of $T$ steps each and compute the policy gradient using the second expression. This procedure is called **Monte-Carlo sampling**. Intuitively, we push up the log-probability of each action in proportion to the total obtained reward.

In CartPole, a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The system is controlled by applying a force of +1 or -1 to the cart. The pole starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over. A reward of +1 is provided for every timestep that the pole remains upright. An episode ends when the pole is more than 15 degrees from vertical, or the cart moves more than 2.4 units from the center. \n",

        "Let's take a closer look at the expression. Recall that the value function essentially tells us how good a state is, averaged across all actions. So intuitively we encourage actions that do better than average, and penalize those that do worse. This algorithm is also called the **advantage actor critic (A2C)** because $G_t - V(s_t)$ approximates the advantage function of a state-ation pair defined as $$A(s_t, a_t) = Q(s_t, a_t) - V(s_t)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "From an advantage function point of view, we are approximating the Q-value of $s$ and $a$ using the discounted future reward of the current trajectory. To stablize training, we can further bootstrap an estimate of the Q-value from the value function (critic). Instead of executing all the way to termination, we rollout $n$-steps and compute $$Q(s_t, a_t) = \\sum_{t'=t}^{t+n-1}\\gamma^{t'-t}r(s_{t'}, a_{t'}) + \\gamma^{n}V(s_{t+n})$$\n",
        "\n",
        "That is, we take $n-1$ real rewards and bootstrap an expected sum of future rewards from the value function. This relates back to TD learning introduced in week 11. In particular, if $n=1$, then the advantage function is approximated by the TD error: $A(s,a) = r + \\gamma V(s') - V(s)$. We present an analysis of the actor-critic algorithm from a TD perspective in the appendix. \n",

        "One issue with RL algorthms we've seen so far is bad sampling efficiency. Both DQN and policy gradient require huge amounts of environment interactions to be effective. This makes it difficult to apply reinforcement learning to problems where data colloection can be slow or expensive. Sampling efficiency can be greatly improved if we have an internal representation of the environment from which we can obtain additional data. This technique is called model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL). In MBRL, we learn a model of the transition dynamics (and sometimes the reward function) of the environment. The simplist model is a neural network $f_{\\theta}$ which predicts the next state give the current state and action: $s_{t+1} = f_{\\theta}(s_t, a_t)$. Having a model opens up many possibilities. Broadly speaking, we can either augment policy DQN / gradient with experience sampled from the model, or apply planning techniques to find the optimal action.\n",
        "\n",
        "Besides good sampling efficiency, another motivation for MBRL is fast adaptation. Consider a task where a robotic arm needs to reach a goal. We can easily train the agent to reach a fixed goal, but what if we want it to reach another goal? Model-free RL techniques would have to learn everything from scratch again. However, note that when the goal changes, the underlying physics doesn't. Thus, using MBRL, we can keep the dynamics model and only adapt the reward model to the new goal, enabling the agent to quickly solve the new task."

        "\n",
        "We will not go into details of model-based policy optimization or Q-learning. Instead, we will dedicate this section to introducing some planning techniques that can be used to directly find the optimal action given a learned model. Given a model, here are a few things we can do:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. If the state space is small, we can apply dynamic programming techniques like policy/value iteration to find an optimal policy. Recall that policy/value iteration assumes full knowledge of the dynamics and rewards, which the model approximates.\n",
        "2. If the state space is large, we can consider an approach introduced all the way back in week 1: Monte-Carlo tree search. Note that AlphaZero is not model-based. We use MCTS because we know the transitions of an Chess game.\n",
        "3. The previous cases assume discrete actions. With a continuous action space, we resort to trajectory optimization techniques. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's take a look at a sampling-based trajectory optimization technique called the cross-entropy (CE) method. Say we are currently at state $s$. Our goal is to find a sequence of actions $a_1, \\dots a_H$ that maximize the reward. $H$ is the horizon of the plan. To do this, let's try modeling the action squence using an isotropic gaussian distribution, with means $\\mu_1, \\dots, \\mu_H$ and standard deviations $\\sigma_1, \\dots \\sigma_H$. We want to update this distribution to eventually sample a good sequence from it. To do this, we initialize the distribution to unit gaussian and repeat the following process:\n",
        "```\n",
        "Repeat for s steps:\n",
        "    Sample n action sequences from the current distribution.\n",
        "    Roll out the sequences through our model (starting at s) and compute the reward for each trajectory.\n",
        "    Re-fit our distribution to the top k action sequences. We do this by updating the means and stds to the means and stds of these k samples.\n",
        "```\n",
        "Finally, we sample an action sequence from the final distribution and execute the plan. In practice, the model is not perfect, and its prediction error will compound as we roll out many steps. Thus we typically execute only the first action from the sampled sequence and replan. This is called model-predictive control (MPC).\n",
        "\n",
        "The following code is a demo for the CE method. We created a toy environment where a point is initialized at (0, 0) and needs to reach (10, 10). The actions are offsets in the x and y directions, and they are clipped to be within (-1, -1) and (1, 1). We use the environment itself as a perfect model and apply the CE method to plan from the initial state. \n",

This makes sense because the model has limited capacity and we want it be accurate on parts of the state space that we care about. Below is a sketch of an MBRL algorithm with on-policy data collection.\n",

This will look a lot like supervised learning. The only caveat is that you will train the model to predict the state difference $\\Delta s = s_{t+1} - s_{t}$, which is easier to learn when $s_t$ and $s_{t+1}$ are very similar. The next state can be reconstructed by adding the difference to the current state. Follow the instructions to fill in the `update` and `predict` methods of the dynamics model."

Learning is always on-policy: the critic must learn about and critique whatever policy is currently followed by the actor. Typically, the critic is a state-value function.
