        "Up to this point, we have mainly been concerned with supervised learning. In a supervised learning problem, we are provided with a dataset where each sample comes with a ground truth label (e.g. class label), and the goal is to learn to predict the label by minimizing some loss function. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is a framework for solving sequential decision-making problems. Consider an agent operating in some environment. The agent's goal is to carry out the best sequence of actions that maximizes the cumulative reward. This is difficult because the action at the current time step influences future states of the environment, which then feed back to the agent's observations. The following figure illustrates this setting. \n",

        "What is the role of reinforcement learning in intelligence? According to Yann LeCun, if intelligence is a cake, then unsupervised learning is the bulk of the cake, supervised learning the icing, and reinforcement learning the cherry on top. The reason RL takes up such a small proportion is that very little learning in real world comes with explicit reward signal. This analogy is still debatable, as some RL folks argue that intelligence is more like a cake with lots of cherries on top, especially after the invention of [hindight experience replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495). In addition, there are ways to solve sequential decision making problems without relying on shaped rewards, such as inverse reinforcement learning, which infers a reward function from experience, and learning from goals / demonstrations / examples. Another way to put RL in perspective is by comparing it with vision and natural language processing. If we decompose intelligence into perception, cognition (reasoning), and action (decision making), then vision coarsely corresponds to perception, NLP cognition, and RL action. Just like how vision can be combined with NLP for tasks like image captioning, RL can be organically combined with vision and NLP as well. \n",

The agent starts from the initial state and aims to reach the terminal state. There are four actions: up, left, down, and right. Each action leads to a **deterministic** transition to the adjacent cell in the correspond direction.

        "Up until now we have assumed full access to the transitions of an environment. But in a typical reinforcement learning problem the dynamics is unknown. So how do we solve it? One way is to learn to approximate the dynamics using a function approximator (e.g. a neural net) and then apply dynamic programming or trajectory optimization. This is called model-based reinforcement learning, which we will cover next week. In this tutorial, we will study algorithms in the model-free regime. Specifically, we will investigate **Temporal Difference (TD) learning**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea behind TD learning is to use $V(s_{t+1})$ as an imperfect proxy for the true value (Monte Carlo bootstrapping), and obtain a generalized equation to calculate the TD error:\n",
        "$$\\delta_t = r_{t+1} + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The expression $r_{t+1} + \\gamma V(s_{t+1})$ is also called the TD target. We can then update the value using a learning rate $\\alpha$.\n",
        "$$ V(s_t) \\leftarrow V(s_t) + \\alpha \\delta_t$$\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q-learning** is an instantiation of TD learning, where the TD error is $$\\delta_t = R(s_t, a_t) + \\gamma \\max_{a} Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t)$$ and the full update rule is $$Q(s_t,a_t) \\leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \\alpha \\left(R(s_t, a_t) + \\gamma \\max_{a} Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t)\\right)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of the max operator used to select the optimal Q-value in the TD target, Q-learning directly estimates the optimal action value, i.e. the cumulative future reward that would be obtained if the agent behaved optimally, regardless of the policy currently followed by the agent. For this reason, Q-learning is referred to as an **off-policy** method. A sketch of the Q-learning algorithm is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "for n episodes:\n",
        "    for T steps:\n",
        "        Select an action a_t using some policy derived from the current Q-values\n",
        "        Execute a_t in the environment to get reward r and next state s_{t+1}\n",
        "        Update Q(s_t, a_t) using (s_t, a_t, r, s_{t+1})\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "A remaining question is, how do we select an action base on the current Q-values? If the approximated Q-values are very bad, then greedily following the argmax policy may cause the agent to get stuck in some bad states. Thus, we instead adopt an **epsilon-greedy policy**, where we choose the argmax action with probability $(1-\\epsilon)$ and take a random action otherwise. This relates to an important concept in reinforcement learning, namely exploration vs. exploitation. "
